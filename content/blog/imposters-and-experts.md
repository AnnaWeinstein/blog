I was once on the phone with a salesman for a commercial database product, trying to determine whether it was something I wanted to purchase and adapt for the organization I was working with at the time. It was not our first conversation, and we were pretty deep in the weeds of whether certain specifications were available. Feeling like I was getting pretty generic and vague (but emphatic!) reassurances that the very expensive product would meet all our needs, I asked a pretty straightforward question. The salesman responded: "Well, since you used the term 'API' correctly, I can now tell you that actually we won't be able to meet your specifications." 

So if I hadn't passed this random guy's vocabulary test, he would have been happy to sell me a product that wouldn't do what I needed, for a huge and unrefundable amount of my employer's money? Cool.

Here are some things I learned from that experience:

### I have just as much right to "use that term correctly" as anyone else.

This experience is very common, and very gendered. I have never considered myself a tech person, but how much of that is because of social conditioning to not claim expertise? This is especially true in hard sciences, technology, etc. I have worked on and led all kinds of tech-related projects and am very comfortable in back-end fiddling in various coding languages and platforms. I do not need to abide by some random sales dude's arbitrary gatekeeping, but I sure can hop that gate if I want to.

So, not thinking of myself as a coder, I've always been a very detail-oriented (read: irritatingly meticulous) person
