---

My work has focused on communications, marketing and product management for nonprofit organizations and other mission-driven entities. I have experience at all levels, from managing video production, website design, and database maintenance, to creating large-scale strategic plans and change-management processes. My particular interests include communications strategy, nonprofit governance, and conflict resolution. I am always interested in talking to people about the challenges facing their organizations, so please drop me a line.
