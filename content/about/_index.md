Hi, I'm Anna. Welcome to my website.

I specialize in communications and marketing for nonprofit organizations and other mission-driven entities. I have experience at all levels, from managing day-to-day social media, website design, and database maintenance, to creating large-scale strategic plans and change management processes. I've overseen major nonprofit governance and policy initiatives, and been at the heart of successful conflict resolution processes. I particularly love video and audio production.

I learn very quickly. I built this website in R Markdown, for example, having never done any R coding before. By the end of a year doing an MA (in English) in Costa Rica, I was able to do live interpretation for mock refugee interviews. I'm also fluent in German and pretty decent in French.

I love talking with people about their work, and consulting on projects I might be able to help with. So drop me a line!
